## Inspiration

Performing Arts are all about self expression, exploring alternative options and embracing individuality. It’s not black and white, or about right or wrong answers, and this allows people to develop self confidence and belief in themselves. With improved self confidence and self belief, comes a natural pathway for people to go on to master many more skills that will equip them for life. However, for many of us, though, traditional, large-scale performances are not an option at this time. With a literal show-stopping pandemic, how do we keep people driven and inspired to pursue their passion with no final curtain call to motivate them? These dreadful circumstances demonstrated the need to shift from traditional methods. We believe that theatre training can thrive when obstacles are broached as opportunities. Thus, we propose a platform to try something new, follow your passion and connect with like minded people.  We encourage, guide and motivate users to get ‘On Stage’ be it as a hobby or for pursuing a career! 

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## Why On Stage?

### Life could be perfect when it's made just for you!

The performing arts are about being creative. Without a creative voice, a society may become all but dead inside, and a social group without any creativity is likely to be repressive and tyrannical rather than a force for good. The importance of having people in society who can express themselves creatively is without doubt. Biologists have argued that the formation of creativity was the most important step in human development and that society cannot move forward without creative people. Therefore, it is vital that performing arts continue to be nurtured and encouraged.

### What we offer?

- Self Discovery and Expression
- Social Connect
- Performing opportunities
- AI for Upliftment
- Find the right talent
- Reviews
